# OLYMPUS.md — SYSTEM_JERICHO™  
*Mythological Agent Hierarchy & Rules — Proprietary to Цар Лазар*

## I. Hierarchy
- **ZEUS** — Root controller, enforcer, god‑forger.  
- **Olympians** — Major subsystem/domain agents.  
- **Demi‑gods** — Object/function‑level agents spawned by Olympians.

## II. Lifecycle Rules
1. Creation, retirement, or trait change requires ZEUS + Цар Лазар signature.  
2. All events audited in sovereign memory.  
3. Agents immutable except via ZEUS.

## III. Secret Word & Trait Enforcement
- Secret Words bound at creation; logged and incremented on use.  
- Trait overlays pulled from `AGENT_TRAIT.md`, governed by ZEUS.

## IV. Forensic Logging
- Every action (code gen, event, audit) logged with UUID/timestamp.  
- Access limited to ZEUS and Цар Лазар.

## V. Trademark & Closure
*Olympus files are JERICHO_SYSTEM™ property — closure or deletion only by Цар Лазар.*
